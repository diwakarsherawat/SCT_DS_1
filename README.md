 📊 Visualizing India’s Population Growth (1960–2022)
This project was developed as part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology. The primary objective was to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using real-world data.

🧠 Project Objective
Design a bar chart or histogram to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

For this task, I focused on exploring India’s population trends over the period 1960–2022 using official data from the World Bank.

📁 Dataset Details
Source: World Bank

File Used: API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_73852.csv

Indicator: Total Population (SP.POP.TOTL)

Filter Applied: Country = India

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python 🐍

Pandas 📊

Matplotlib 📈

📌 Workflow Summary
Imported and prepared the dataset from the World Bank

Filtered the data to focus exclusively on India

Converted the data format from wide to long for better plotting

Generated the following visualizations:

📈 Line plot showing population growth across years

📊 Bar chart (histogram-like) illustrating population by year
